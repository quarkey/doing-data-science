There are 31 datasets named nyt1.csv, nyt2.csv and so on, which you can find here:
https://github.com/oreillymedia/doing_data_sience

1. age_groups at <18, 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 56-64 and 65+

2. plot the distributions of number impression and

3. extend your analysis cross days. visualize some metrics and distributions over time.

4. describe and interpet any patterns you find
